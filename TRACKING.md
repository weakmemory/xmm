## Outline

* This document lists planned proofs.
* A checkmark next to an item means that the item is finished and present in the `main` branch
* A **username** next to an item means that it is being actively worked on
* Lack of a **username** next to an item means that it is not being actively worked on

        - [x] Deploy the fix for the `StableUncommittedReads`, including the fixes of all proofs reasoning about it [commit](weakmemory/xmm/f9742bc1094d4b2bdffec5835afb889f9224afc1)
        - [x] Prove the inclusion of srf into the thrdle relation [commit](weakmemory/xmm/148c9e30a13db554e305380252be3949e712169b)
        - [x] Prove the inclusion of other `rf` edges (merge into `main` past this step)
        - [ ] Prove the well-formedness of the starting configuration
        - [x] Prove all other conditions of the `re-execute` step
            - [x] Commit-embeded up-to rpo [commit](https://github.com/weakmemory/xmm/commit/259a1698508bc26ffa74edc193c5dcff92a16d5b)
            - [x] Add the new constraints and patch all lemmas up-to-rexec [commit1](https://github.com/weakmemory/xmm/commit/aaa3968807c1239e1496273ae67e82a1d518d401), [commit2](https://github.com/weakmemory/xmm/commit/e739362f70188d3259b694b08a877ce58a7320f8)
            - [x] Prove the new constraint about act set [commit](https://github.com/weakmemory/xmm/commit/a7c242f8423800ba8c8b31e559ca9a085c6cc8ed)
            - [x] Prove the new constraint about po-maximality of determined events
- [ ] Full Reordering Proof
    - [ ] Universal `src/reordering/Reordering.v:simrel_xmm_step` lemma
    - [ ] [@InnocentusLime](https://www.github.com/InnocentusLime) Full `Theorem` (this would be the master theorem that uses `simrel_xmm_step` in its proof)
        * The theorem itself should be `Qed`'d with the only `admit`'d fact being the `simrel_xmm_step` lemma.
    - [ ] Proper constraint of the trace family for `G_s'`
    - Constraints of the current result
        * `a` and `b` must have static indices in both source and target graphs
        * `rmw` operations are considered to be in SC mode
        * Both source and target are finite graphs
        * both `a` and `b` are at most relaxed
- [ ] [@InnocentusLime](https://www.github.com/InnocentusLime) Document constraints
    - The main foundational constaints should be converted into `Hypothesis` declarations
    - Each hypothesis should be followed by a comment
